MLOps stands for machine learning operations and refers to the process of managing the machine learning life cycle, from development to deployment and monitoring. It involves tasks such as:

- **Experiment tracking**: Keeping track of experiments and results to identify the best models
- **Model deployment**: Deploying models to production and making them accessible to applications
- **Model monitoring**: Monitoring models to detect any issues or degradation in performance
- **Model retraining**: Retraining models with new data to improve their performance

MLOps is essential for ensuring that machine learning models are reliable, scalable, and maintainable in production environments.
