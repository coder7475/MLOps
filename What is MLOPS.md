The combination of **people**, **process** & **technology** to productionize ML solutions efficiently.
### Definitions
##### By Google Cloud:

**MLOps** stands for **machine learning operations** and refers to the process of managing the **machine learning life cycle**, from development to deployment and monitoring.

It involves tasks such as:
- **Experiment tracking**: Keeping track of experiments and results to identify the best models
- **Model deployment**: Deploying models to production and making them accessible to applications
- **Model monitoring**: Monitoring models to detect any issues or degradation in performance
- **Model retraining**: Retraining models with new data to improve their performance

**MLOps** is essential for ensuring that machine learning models are **reliable**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** in production environments.

##### By AWS:

Machine learning operations (**MLOps**) are a set of practices that **automate** and **simplify** [machine learning (ML)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/) workflows and deployments. 

Machine learning and [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/artificial-intelligence/) are core capabilities that you can implement to solve complex real-world problems and deliver value to your customers. 

**MLOps** is an ML **culture** and **practice** that unifies ML application development (**Dev**) with ML system deployment and operations (**Ops**). 

We can use **MLOps** to automate and standardize processes across the ML lifecycle. These processes include model development, testing, integration, release, and infrastructure management.
